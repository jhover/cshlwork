Hi John - sure - I copied the functions to my folder on Tyrone (enrich.Rmd).
There are three functions - the prepRankedGeneList takes a DESeq2 (or similar)-style table as input and prepares a ranked list for a PANTHER/GSEA-style analysis by the genesetEnrichment analysis function. This function compares the ranks of genes associated with a GO term relative to all other genes to evaluate whether they are preferentially found at the top or bottom of the ranked list. The second function - fisher_enrichment just performs a classic hypergeometric analysis of GO terms from a provided list of DE (and non-DE genes). In this case you would defined a suitable fold change/p-value threshold and define these two lists.
